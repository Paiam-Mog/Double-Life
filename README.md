# Double-Life

# Game Description
A hybrid FPS/Visual Novel, DOUBLE LIFE is a game about being an assassin and call worker at the same time. Fight against hordes of cops while answering IT support questions and dealing with difficult customers. The game is developed using the Unity Engine.

# Role on the Project
I worked as a supporting engineer on this project as well as a design collaborator with the rest of the team. As an support engineer, I implemented a dialogue system that utilized scriptable objects to help writters to easily add and iterate on the presented text. Additionally, I helped our other engineer design the interplay between the dialogue system and the gameplay as well as provided debugging support.

# Implemented Systems and Features 
Some of the systems and features that I have worked on or implemented during my time include:
 * Dialogue system that utilizes Scriptable Object assets stored in the project to allow for writers to quickly iterate on the dialogue without having to touch any code
